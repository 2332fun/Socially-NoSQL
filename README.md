# Socially-NoSQL

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to make an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. My efforts allow the user to connect to a database using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. When entering the command to invoke the application, the server is started and Insomnia allows the user to see the routes in working order.
