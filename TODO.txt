AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

Need Video Walkthrough showing API routes being tested in Insomnia:

GET routes to return ALL Users and ALL Thoughts
GET routes to return a SINGLE User and a SINGLE Thought
POST routes for Users and Thoughts
PUT routes for Users and Thoughts
DELETE routes for Users and Thoughts
POST routes for a User's FriendList
DELETE routes for a User's FriendList
POST routes for Reactions to Thoughts
DELETE routes for Reactions to Thoughts

Models:
User
    *username
        *String
        *Unique
        *Required
        *Trimmed
    *email
        *String
        *Required
        *Unique
        *Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)
    *thoughts
        *array of _id values referencing the Thought model
    *friends
        *array of _id values referencing the User model (self-reference)
